# Machine_Learning_Thyroid_Data

Trains several algorithms against data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Thyroid+Disease
and attempts to predict whether a patient has Primary Hypothyroidism, Compensated Hypothyroidism,
or Neither.

This project uses Jupyter Notebook, which I've found to be pretty useful for machine learning
applications.

It's still a bit sloppy, and requires comments explaining certain sections of the code.
